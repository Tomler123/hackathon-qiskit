# 🔐 BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Simulator (Hybrid Quantum–Market RNG)

### 🧠 Built with Qiskit • Python • Matplotlib • Tkinter  
### 🚀 Developed for Quantum Hackathon 2025  

---

## 🌌 Overview

This project implements a **fully functional BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** protocol using **Qiskit** — enriched with a **creative random number generation method** that combines **quantum randomness** with **real-world market data**.  

The simulator demonstrates how **Alice** and **Bob** can securely establish a shared secret key — even in the presence of noise or an eavesdropper (**Eve**) — using the quantum properties of measurement and superposition.

It visualizes how Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) evolves across iterations and provides interactive plots to analyze performance under ideal, noisy, and intercepted channels.

## 🧩 Unique Hackathon Twist

Traditional BB84 demos use pseudorandom bits for qubit preparation.  
Here, randomness is **inspired by the real world**:

> 🧮 The bit sequence used by Alice is generated by a **hybrid quantum–market random number generator**:
>
> 1. A **quantum circuit** (Hadamard + measurement) generates an 8-bit seed.  
> 2. The seed selects a **random stock symbol** (e.g., AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, AMZN...).  
> 3. The simulator fetches the latest **1-minute close price** via `yfinance`.  
> 4. The **last cent digit** of the stock price determines the bit parity:  
>     - Even → `0`  
>     - Odd → `1`  
> 5. If data is missing or offline, it falls back to pure quantum randomness.

This produces **real-world-influenced entropy**, demonstrating how *hybrid quantum-classical randomness* can enhance practical cryptographic systems.
